#### RSS Feeds

RSS Feeds are available in two different flavours, Atom and JSON. Pick whichever one suits your needs best.

* [Atom RSS Feed](/feed.xml)
* [JSON RSS Feed](/feed.json)

#### Other (sub)domains

Believe it or not, there's more than just [blog.vilijur.fish](/). Though, they're not quite as polished as this site. Not like this is very polished but it's the most polished in comparison to the rest!

* [vilijur.fish](https://vilijur.fish) - Warning: contains fish
* [amazong.vilijur.fish](https://amazong.vilijur.fish) - A [single html document](https://github.com/vilijur/amazong.vilijur.fish) made as an inside joke that I cannot be bothered with taking down.
* [blog.vilijur.fish](/) - You're already here..

Well, there's only slightly more. Oops.
