``` SpongeBob
SpongeBob: Hi Squidward!

Squidward: August 12th 2036. The heat death of the universe. August 12th 2036. The heat death of the universe. August 12th 2036. The heat death of the universe.

SpongeBob: What are you doing?

Squidward: Repeating this meaningless phrase over again over again in hopes that it'll mean something someday.

SpongeBob: Why don't you just say something interesting?

Squidward: Like what?

SpongeBob: I don't know, anything!

Squidward: I don't know what to say.

SpongeBob: How about "I love you"?

Squidward: I'm not saying that.
