Welcome to my little corner of the Internet. As of writing this, there's not much here, though hopefully that changes soon. But what exactly can you find here?

I wonder that too...

## Site Navigation
***
You might find it good to know a few things about this site.

If you can't use the Post and Tags button in the menu on your browser for whatever reason, you can go [here](/tags/) to navigate the tags manually, and [here](/tags/posts/) to see all posts.

There is also the [Extra](/extra/) page with some additional neat things that I don't know where to put so i made it into a permanent button. Oops!

## About Me

***
Now would be a good time to ask... what is a vilijur? That's me. Hello! I'm vilijur, I make stuff in Blender, I enjoy Nintendo games, and I think fish are funny. I'm acting all profreshional here but in actuality I'm way more silly. So you'll probably see my silliness shine a bit here. Hopefully that isn't too much of an issue...

You might be wondering **why** the icon is of a goldfish with pink hair and an eyepatch? If you are, then I shall respond with another question: *Why not?* I did buy a domain that ends in `.fish` and I'd be dammed not to incorporate it in some way. Also, it's a goldfish because I'm a tad bit forgetful... just a tad.

### Blender

I've made quite a lot of renders over the few years I've been using Blender. I wouldn't say they're professional grade by any means, but I'm pretty satisfied with what I've managed to create so far. Currently, you can find my artwork [on my Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/vilijur.fish/feed/aaalamsgnhmcc), though I am hoping to move them onto a platform I have control over eventually. They were originally on my Twitter account, buuuut... some things may have happened and I may no longer have any of the posts on there at all... oops.

## Goals

***
As of writing this, the blog is currently in a very, very simple form. There's not much here, but I am planning to post stuff here somewhat regularly. Some things you can possibly expect include, but are not limited to:

* Behind the scenes on a project (such as a render)
* Some neat trivia
* Development logs on a project I'm working on, and
* Whatever I feel like talking about that day.

After all, it is my blog. I could put anything I want on it... maybe I'll add more fish...

This would be the part where I'd ask for feedback but I don't quite have that setup on here. I guess you can send me a message on one of the links at the bottom of every page. You're not obligated to, but you can! If you want! Assuming you don't already have an easier means to contact me directly!
